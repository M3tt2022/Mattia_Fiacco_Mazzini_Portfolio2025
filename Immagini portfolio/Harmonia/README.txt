HARMONIA PROJECT IMAGES GUIDE

This folder is intended to store images for the Harmonia project in your portfolio.

To complete the project presentation with images from the slides you shared:

1. For the project card image:
   - Take a screenshot of the first slide with the "Harmonia" title and save it as "harmonia_main.jpg" or "harmonia_main.png" in this folder.

2. For section images in the project detail page:
   - Problem Statement: Use the slide with the elderly woman looking at her phone
   - User Research: Use the slide with the Trevi Fountain or user personas
   - User Personas: Use the slide with Maria Rossi persona
   - The Solution: Use the slide with the Smart Totem or system map
   - Design Process: Use the low-fidelity prototype sketches

3. For the gallery section:
   - Include 6 images from various slides showing different aspects of the project
   - Focus on the interface designs, user experience, and system diagrams

4. How to add images to the HTML:
   - In projects/harmonia.html, replace the placeholder comments with actual image tags
   - Example: 
     <!-- Placeholder for project overview image -->
     Replace with:
     <img src="../Immagini portfolio/Harmonia/harmonia_main.jpg" alt="Harmonia Project Overview" style="width:100%; height:100%; object-fit:cover;">

5. For the project card on the main pages:
   - In projects.html and index.html, add the main image to the project card
   - Example:
     <div class="project-image" style="background-image: url('Immagini portfolio/Harmonia/harmonia_main.jpg'); background-size: cover; background-position: center;">

A placeholder HTML file (placeholder.html) has been created that you can open in a browser and screenshot to use as a temporary image until you add the actual slides.
